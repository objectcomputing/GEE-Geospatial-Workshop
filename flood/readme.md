# Flood Model - README

## Overview
This document provides a systematic guide to developing a comprehensive flood model. The process encapsulated within focuses on leveraging varied datasets, tools, and methodologies to create accurate and actionable flood risk maps.

## Workflow:

### 1. Decision on Natural Event
- **Focus**: Decide on the specific natural event and region you are analyzing.
- **Guidance**: Prioritize areas with significant rainfall or water surge events to maximize the model's effectiveness.

### 2. Define Area of Interest (AOI) & Relevant Dates
- **AOI**: Define the specific area that experienced the natural event.
- **Dates**: Specify the date range of the event.

### 3. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Data Collection & Processing
- **Guidance**: Choose the most appropriate band (e.g., VH, VV) based on the region's characteristics and data quality.
- **Outcome**: Derive a water/flood inundation map from the processed SAR data.

### 4. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) Processing
- **Objective**: Obtain elevation data to understand terrain properties, which will guide water flow.

### 5. Hydrology Analysis in GIS Tools
- **Components Analyzed**:
  - Slope
  - Water direction & accumulation
  - Distance to streams/channels
- **Outcome**: Acquire hydrological insights to predict and assess water flow patterns.

### 6. Landcover Data Collection
- **Objective**: Understand terrain types, vegetation, and urbanized areas, which impact flood behavior.

### 7. Collect Rainfall Data
- **Guidance**: Obtain data from relevant meteorological organizations or databases for the specified AOI and dates.

### 8. Cloud Optimized Geotiff (COG) Conversion
- **Datasets to Convert**:
  - DEM
  - Slope
  - Flow accumulation
  - Landcover
  - Precipitation
  - SAR before the event

### 9. Data Ingestion into Geospatial Platforms
- **Objective**: Ingest the data into platforms like Google Earth Engine (GEE) for further processing and visualization.

### 10. Convert Raster Data to Database-Friendly Format
- **Objective**: Convert processed raster data into tables or other database-friendly formats for analysis and storage.

### 11. Train/Retrain the Flood Model
- **Guidance**: Use relevant event data to train or finetune your flood prediction model.

### 12. Generate Contingency Table
- **Objective**: Assess the model's performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

### 13. Generate Predictions for Other Relevant Areas
- **Guidance**: Apply the trained model to other regions of interest to understand its generalization capabilities.

### 14. Generate Optimized Geotiffs for Risk Maps
- **Objective**: Convert risk maps into geotiff formats optimized for geospatial platforms.

### 15. Visualize Risk Maps on Geospatial Platforms
- **Guidance**: Use platforms like GEE or GIS tools for visualization and further analysis.

### 16. Create Proprietary Flood-risk Maps (If Required)
- **Objective**: Design and customize flood-risk maps specific to certain platforms or client requirements.

## Supplementary Analysis
The flood model can be enhanced by integrating census data and building data from sources like OpenStreetMaps. This ensures a holistic risk assessment, considering population density, infrastructure, and other critical factors.

## Best Practices & Notes
- Ensure all datasets have appropriate access rights and permissions.
- Regularly backup data and processed files.
- Validate the model against ground truth or reliable data sources for accuracy.
- Collaborate with domain experts for nuanced insights.
